## Usage

To use the Exodus Passphrase Extractor, follow these steps:

1. **Open the application**.
2. **Load your wallet file**: Click on the "Load Wallet" button and select your Exodus wallet file.
3. **Set your options**: You can define the character set and length for the brute force attack.
4. **Start the extraction**: Click the "Start" button to begin the process.
5. **Monitor the progress**: The application will display the current status and any found passphrases.

### Example Command Line Usage

For users who prefer command line:

```bash
./exodus-passphrase-extractor --wallet your_wallet_file --charset abc123 --length 6
```

## How It Works

The Exodus Passphrase Extractor uses a brute force algorithm to systematically try all possible combinations of characters until it finds the correct passphrase. 

### Brute Force Algorithm

1. **Character Set**: Users can specify which characters to include (e.g., letters, numbers, symbols).
2. **Length**: Users can set the length of the passphrase to test.
3. **Execution**: The tool generates combinations and checks them against the wallet file.

### Performance

The speed of the extraction process depends on the complexity of the passphrase and the power of the user's hardware. More complex passphrases will take longer to crack.

## Supported Wallets

The Exodus Passphrase Extractor primarily focuses on the Exodus wallet but can be adapted for other wallets with similar file structures. 

### Supported Formats

- Exodus Wallet Files (`.wallet`)
- Other Bitcoin Wallet Formats (with modifications)
